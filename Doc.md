Below I’ll:

1. list concrete quantitative models/strategies you can build with the realtime greeks,
2. show the core math (with the small, important formulas),
3. give practical signal / execution rules and implementation notes (data + infra + backtest tips), and
4. provide a short priority roadmap.

# 1) High-value models & strategies you can build (by Greek focus)

### A. **Delta-hedged Gamma-Scalping**

- Take a directional-neutral options position (e.g., long call/put or straddle) and keep it delta-hedged with the underlying.
- Profit when realized variance > implied variance (you capture gamma).
- Uses: `delta` (for hedge size), `gamma` (for expected P&L sensitivity), `theta` (time decay).

### B. **Vega / Volatility Momentum Strategies**

- Trade options whose implied volatility (IV) moves persistently vs. historical/realized vol.
- Long options when IV expected to rise; short options when IV rich.
- Uses: `IV`, `vega`, `theta`.

### C. **Volatility Surface Monitoring & Arbitrage**

- Build live IV surface across strikes/expiries; detect mispricings (calendar, vertical, butterfly arbitrage).
- Execute calendar spreads (buy front, sell back) when forward vols diverge from expectations.
- Uses: `IV` across strikes/expiries + `vega` exposure.

### D. **Skew / Dispersion Trading**

- Long/short relative IV between index options (implied index vol) vs. basket of single-name options (dispersion).
- Uses: `IV`, `delta`/`vega` per contract.

### E. **Market Making / Automated Quoting**

- Use `delta` & `gamma` to size quotes and `theta`/`vega` to set spread & inventory targets.
- Manage inventory by hedging delta and limiting gamma/vega exposure.

### F. **Dynamic Hedging & Real-time Risk Control**

- Real-time portfolio Greeks aggregation; auto-hedge when thresholds exceeded.
- Use `rho` for interest sensitive trades and `theta` for carry management.

### G. **Greeks-driven Machine Learning Signals**

- Build features like delta-scaled orderflow, gamma concentration, vega-weighted flow, IV momentum; feed to a classifier/regressor for entry/exit.

### H. **Local Vol / Implied Forward Vol Estimation**

- Use cross-section IVs to construct local vol surface or forward vols (Dupire / bootstrapping methods) for pricing and hedging.

# 2) Core math & P&L decomposition (must-know formulas)

Small-move Taylor expansion for option price change (Δt small, ΔS small, ΔIV small):

Option price change ≈

`ΔC ≈ delta * ΔS + 0.5 * gamma * (ΔS)^2 + vega * ΔIV + theta * Δt + ...`

**Delta-hedged P&L (first term removed):**

`P&L ≈ 0.5 * gamma * (ΔS)^2 + vega * ΔIV + theta * Δt`

Example (digit-by-digit arithmetic shown):

- long 1 ATM call with `gamma = 0.02`, `theta = -0.05` per day.
- underlying moves `ΔS = +1` (₹1).
- compute `0.5 * gamma * (ΔS)^2`:
    - `0.5 * 0.02 = 0.01`
    - `0.01 * (1)^2 = 0.01` → expected positive contribution ₹0.01 per option
- `theta * Δt` for 1 day = `0.05` → loss ₹0.05
- net approx for the day ≈ `0.01 - 0.05 = -0.04` (so you still lose on net unless realized moves or IV change make up for theta).

This highlights: **gamma scalping profits require enough realized variance** or quick re-hedges; theta is the drag.

# 3) Concrete signals, entry/exit rules & examples

### Gamma-Scalp (delta-hedged single leg)

- Universe: liquid ATM options (high gamma, tight spreads).
- Entry: Buy ATM straddle when IV (near expiry) is below realized vol + volatility risk premium threshold.
- Hedge: Rebalance delta continuously (or every N ticks / when |delta| > threshold).
- Exit: IV rises above entry IV + target or when remaining theta becomes too large.
- Execution: Use underlying market to hedge; ensure transaction costs < expected gamma P&L.

### Vega Momentum Trade

- Signal: `IV_now - IV_rolling_mean(20min)` > threshold → short IV mean-reversion; opposite for long.
- Size = target vega exposure / contract vega.
- Risk control: limit max vega, stress test with IV shock scenarios.

### Calendar Spread (front vs back)

- Signal: front IV cheap vs back by X bps relative to historical forward vols.
- Construct long front (lower expiry) and short back (higher expiry) to capture convergence.
- Monitor: forward vol changes and carry cost (theta difference).

### Skew Arbitrage (butterfly / vertical)

- Example: If put skew steepness diverges vs historical, create butterflies to exploit mean reversion in skew.
- Use Greeks to size: gamma & vega per leg to ensure exposures match risk appetite.

### Market Making / Dynamic Quoting Rules

- Quote mid ± spread function(spread_base, implied_vol, vega_exposure).
- Reduce quote size when `portfolio_gamma` or `portfolio_vega` exceeds risk budget.
- Hedge delta continuously; hedge vega/gamma by offsetting options/OTC where available.

# 4) Data & infra requirements (practical)

### Data to capture (store tick-level):

- trade ticks: timestamp, symbolid, LTP, LTQ, tick sequence.
- bidask updates: price & sizes (to reconstruct orderbook).
- touchline snapshots at pre-open / on subscribe.
- Greeks feed: `"symbolid", timestamp, delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho, IV`.
- Masters and option chain metadata (strike, expiry, type).

### Storage & processing:

- Time-series DB for tick data (compressed), low-latency caches for live Greeks.
- Replay capability (must store sequence numbers) for backtest.
- Real-time engine: vectorized Greek aggregations per portfolio and per leg.

### Latency & execution:

- For gamma scalping, latency matters — need fast hedge execution.
- For mid-frequency vega plays, latency less critical; accuracy of IV and vega is key.

# 5) Backtesting & evaluation best practices

- **Tick-level backtest**: replays trades + bid/ask updates + greeks; simulate hedging costs & slippage.
- **Transaction cost model**: include spread, slippage per size, exchange fees, and hedging fill probability.
- **Realized vs implied vol test**: compute realized variance on the same data frequency; compare with IV time series.
- **Walk-forward validation**: re-calibrate thresholds frequently; avoid look-ahead on IV surface.
- **Stress tests**: IV shocks, sudden gamma spikes (short gamma blowups), liquidity dry-ups.

---

# 6) Risk management & controls (use realtime Greeks)

- Set max portfolio exposures: `|net_delta|`, `|net_gamma|`, `|net_vega|`, `max_theta_loss/day`.
- Real-time kill switches if `portfolio_gamma` * spot_volatility_estimate > risk_limit.
- Use `rho` to assess interest rate sensitivity for long-dated options.

# 7) Practical implementation snippets (pseudocode)

Delta hedge sizing every tick (simplified):

```
# per option contract i:
delta_i = greeks[i].delta               # options delta
size_i  = positions[i]                  # number of contracts
net_option_delta = sum(size_i * delta_i * contract_multiplier)

# desired hedge in underlying = -net_option_delta
if abs(net_option_delta) > hedge_threshold:
    send_order(symbol=underlying, qty= -net_option_delta)

```

Gamma-scalp expected daily edge (monitor):

```
expected_gamma_edge = 0.5 * portfolio_gamma * expected_variance_today
expected_theta_cost   = portfolio_theta
expected_vega_effect  = portfolio_vega * expected_IV_move

expected_edge = expected_gamma_edge + expected_vega_effect + expected_theta_cost

```

# 8) Example prioritized roadmap (what to build first)

1. **Data plumbing & storage**
    - Subscribe to spot/fut and all option contracts; store ticks and greeks; build mapping symbolid↔symbol.
2. **Realtime Greeks aggregator**
    - Live portfolio-level delta/gamma/vega/theta/IV dashboards & alerts.
3. **Tick-level replay/backtest engine**
    - Validate strategies offline with realistic fills.
4. **Simple delta-hedged strategy**
    - Implement a gamma-scalp on liquid ATM straddles with conservative sizing.
5. **Vega momentum & calendar spreads**
    - Add IV surface and calendar trade engine.
6. **Market making & quoting**
    - Add inventory controls and auto-quoting with greeks limits.
7. **ML features & advanced local vol**
    - Build ML models using greeks-derived features and local vol surface if needed.

# 9) Practical pitfalls to watch for

- Greeks are model outputs — they depend on the model used by backend; confirm conventions (e.g., option pricing model, dividend handling).
- Latency of Greeks vs underlying quotes — stale greeks can mislead.
- Transaction costs & illiquidity: short gamma can blow up quickly.
- Discrete hedging: frequent re-hedging increases costs; choose cadence vs continuous approximation.
